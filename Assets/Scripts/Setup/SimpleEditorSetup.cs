üéÆ SIMPLE FOOTBALL CONTROLS üéÆ

üîß MOVEMENT:
- W/A/S/D: Move player (keyboard)
- Left Stick: Move player (PS5 controller)
- Left Shift: Run (keyboard)
- Square Button: Run (PS5 controller)

üîÑ TEAM CONTROLS:
- Tab: Switch between players (keyboard)
- Triangle Button: Switch between players (PS5 controller)
- Only one player is controllable at a time

üèà TESTING:
1. Press Play in Unity
2. You'll see TWO blue players - one with a red pulsing circle
3. Use WASD or left stick to move the active player
4. Hold Shift or Square to run faster
5. Press Tab or Triangle to switch between players
6. Camera follows the active player

üìù SETUP STEPS:
1. Run 'Simple Football/Setup Testing Scene'
2. Press Play to test (2 players created automatically)
3. Use 'Add Another Player' to add more players

üõ†Ô∏è TROUBLESHOOTING:
If you don't see 2 players or the red indicator:
1. Try 'Simple Football/Test Setup (Manual)' instead
2. Check the Console for debug messages
3. Make sure you have a Main Camera in the scene

‚úÖ CONTROLLER SUPPORT:
- PS5 controller support through Unity's standard input
- Left stick for movement, Square for running, Triangle for switching
- Works automatically alongside keyboard controls
- Lower camera angle for better gameplay view

üî¥ VISUAL INDICATOR:
- Red pulsing circle shows which player you're controlling
- Ready for team colors (red/blue) in multiplayer

This version works without the Input System package!
